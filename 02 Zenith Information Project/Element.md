Element is a liquid-like substance that is best described as a concentration of knowledge and experience.
Not that much is known about how Element came to exist or how it gained its anomalous properties, but it has been intensely studied by Zenith Information and is commonly incorporated into weaponry made by Combat Tech.
Element is categorized based on the Asolian Classical Elements (fire, metal, water, earth, arche/imagination). Each category is associated with different properties.
