**The Pool**, sometimes called **The River**, is the primary source of [[Element]] that [[02 Zenith Information Project|Zenith Information]] has. It is also one of the only non-Euclidean spaces discovered, the inside of The Pool is significantly larger than the space it takes up on the outside, and can seemingly grow depending on how much information it is fed.
It takes on the form of a chain of rivers that branch out from a seemingly bottomless pond, also called **The Well**. Notably the source starts out as having four branches which themselves branch out, giving a labyrinthine appearance at first glance.
The category of Element that is found depends on where in the Pool it is sourced; Element Arche is found in The Well, where the others can be found in each of the four branches.
The Pool is self-containing.

# History
During the beginning of the [[Great War]] (again, Iâ€™d like a better name for it), there was a large meteorite that fell not so far from [[Heather Campus]], and it was taken in for study upon ZI being informed of strange occurrences happing in the area (such as plants overgrowing but becoming toxic, and locals deforming and going mad). 
Upon studying it, the three Heads of each department at the time ([[Department of Space Exploration|Space Exploration]], [[Department of Combat Technology|Combat Tech]], and [[Department of Psychology|Psych]]) discovered Element, contained it at the top of Heather Campus, and quickly made it Zenith Information's best kept secret.
Shortly after the mysterious death of the Combat Tech head, The Pool was migrated 50 miles underground an empty field near Heather Campus, where the [[Department of Robotics]] was later built.
