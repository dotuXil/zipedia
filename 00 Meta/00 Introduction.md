Welcome to what I call Zipedia, aka the dotuXil textbook, or the dotuXil Cinematic Universe (dXCU) Comprehensive Guide (please don't call it that). It's where I store all my ideas for the silly world that goes on in my head. Usually when I infodump in updates I don't like providing context, so this guide is intended to fill in the gaps.
That being said this is also something I'd like to tell a cohesive story with, so there's planning for that too.
