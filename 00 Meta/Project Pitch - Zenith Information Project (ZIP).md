This is the project pitch of ZIP for my English class. 

# Overview

ZIP is a worldbuilding project I started a couple months ago in the vision of a sci-fi fantasy sort-of-tabletop-esque deckbuilder video game.
The overall plot is that you are a ZIU (basically a human-stuffed robot sent to space 100-200 or so years ago to explore ) named Gridwalker who is newly retrieved from the planet Xisal (who's also a supernatural being who really just appeared in the sky one day), and are now being repurposed by the organization Zenith Information (who is one of the dominant forces on the planet Asola) to do tasks on other planets. From there you learn more about the inner workings of Zenith Information, uncover mysteries about the nature of Xisal, um, other things regarding the world of ZIP (everything else will have to require me to present a bucketload of random disjointed ramble that won't make sense cause I won't bother revising).
The amount of parentheses I used in that sentence is utterly embarrassing but I'll figure out a more concise way to communicate the overall gist of things later. There's lots of detail I'd like to properly document, since I've thought about (and rambled about occasionally) a lot of cool details for it. 

# Product

My goal is to slowly buildup zipedia, which is sometimes what I call the 'worldbuilding bible' for this project. If I have time I might package a little art book and/or lore book.
Zipedia is publicly available at https://github.com/dotuXil/zipedia and updates whenever I feel like I've made enough progress to push changes (which, there hasn't been one in a month, but I'll get to it soon).
### The things that are out of scope for class (but I have in mind for later)
* I'm partially building ZIP from the angle that someday it might become a video game. I would like that to become a reality, but at the moment I... can't gather programmers. Sorry.
* I'd like to host Zipedia online using Obsidian's online hosting service someday, but I will only do it if I or ZIP gains a sizable audience since it's ~$100 a year to host.
* I've had the idea of a ZIP themed music release. There is one single that's in the works right now (though that one is pretty tangential, and I've been procrastinating on it), but beyond that I won't be able to do one in the timeframe we have.

# Significance

I don't feel the need to worry about how significant this is, it being a multimedia creative outlet is enough for me. I also have like three audience members who like hearing me yap anyway.

# Challenges

Most of the challenges boil down to time, tiredness, and scope. If you couldn't tell, they're very significant challenges.
I've experienced firsthand that even if given an hour every Friday for the next few months to work on something like this, it's still not that much time for me (I'm pretty slow). And with the workload I have now, I actually feel I'm in a deficit of energy to do everything that comes before this. 

# Resources

* Online worldbuilding resources
* Wikipedia, my bestest bestest friend for finding general information on things
* Print shops, if I plan on making a booklet
* Teachers and friends for feedback
